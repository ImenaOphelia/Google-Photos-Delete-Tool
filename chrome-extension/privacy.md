# Privacy Policy for Google Photos Delete Tool

Last updated: August 4, 2024

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the Google Photos Delete Tool ("we", "our", or "the extension") collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information Collection and Use

The Google Photos Delete Tool is designed to operate entirely within your browser and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or user data outside of your local browser environment.

### Data Accessed

The extension accesses and interacts with the content of the Google Photos website solely for the purpose of identifying and deleting photos as per your instructions. This includes:

- Viewing photo metadata (such as selection status)
- Interacting with webpage elements to select and delete photos

### Data Storage

No data is stored by the extension beyond the current browsing session. All operations are performed in real-time and are not saved or persisted in any way.

### Data Transmission

The extension does not transmit any data to external servers or third parties. All operations are performed locally within your browser.

## Use of Permissions

The extension requires certain permissions to function:

- `activeTab`: To interact with the Google Photos website
- `https://photos.google.com/*`: To ensure the extension only operates on the Google Photos website

These permissions are used solely for the purpose of performing the photo deletion operations and are not used to collect or transmit any user data.

## Data Security

As the extension does not collect or store any user data, there are no specific data security measures in place beyond the standard security provided by your web browser.

## Changes to User's Google Photos Account

The extension will delete photos from the user's Google Photos account as instructed. Users should be aware that this action is permanent (subject to Google's own data retention policies) and should use the tool with caution.

## Third-Party Services

The extension does not integrate with or use any third-party services or analytics tools.

## Children's Privacy

The extension is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
